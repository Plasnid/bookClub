      Simon Snow is the worst chosen one who's ever been chosen<br /><br />That's what his roommate, Baz, says. And Baz might be evil and a vampire and a complete git, but he's probably right. <br /><br />Half the time Simon can't even make his wand work, and the other half, he sets something on fire. His mentor's avoiding him, his girlfriend broke up with him, and there's a magic-eating monster running around wearing Simon's face. Baz would be having a field day with all this, if he were here - it's their last year at Watford School of Magicks, and Simon's infuriating nemesis didn't even bother to show up. <br /><br /><i>Carry On</i> is a love letter to love stories and the power of words - to every 'chosen one' who ever had more on their mind than saving the world...

      This alluring novel of friendship, love, and cuisine brings the best-selling author of <i>Lost in Translation</i> and <i>A Cup of Light</i> to one of the great Chinese subjects: food. As in her previous novels, Mones’s captivating story also brings into focus a changing China -- this time the hidden world of high culinary culture.<br /><br />When Maggie McElroy, a widowed American food writer, learns of a Chinese paternity claim against her late husband’s estate, she has to go immediately to Beijing. She asks her magazine for time off, but her editor counters with an assignment: to profile the rising culinary star Sam Liang.<br /><br />In China Maggie unties the knots of her husband’s past, finding out more than she expected about him and about herself. With Sam as her guide, she is also drawn deep into a world of food rooted in centuries of history and philosophy. To her surprise she begins to be transformed by the cuisine, by Sam’s family -- a querulous but loving pack of cooks and diners -- and most of all by Sam himself. <i>The Last Chinese Chef</i> is the exhilarating story of a woman regaining her soul in the most unexpected of places.
